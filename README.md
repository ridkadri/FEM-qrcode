## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learnt 2 things in this build. Using a one off CSS value in tailwind using the square brackets. And also using h-screen to splash the specified color on the entire background. Examples below: 

```css
<p className='text-[15px]></p>
<div className='bg-background h-screen'>
```

### Continued development

I will want to continously learn how to use template customization values throughout the project. Use cases like turning screen widths from mobile to desktop.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. The tailwind documentation is a great medium which helpled me throughout the build. I will strongly recommend it to anyone who is building using tailwind css.
